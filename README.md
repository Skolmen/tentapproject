# TentaP Project
The background of this project is that during exam periods, my friends and I book group rooms. Before this project, one of us kept track of which room was booked and who should book for the upcoming days. That process was tedious, inefficient, and prone to errors. Therefore, I created this project to keep track of which rooms are booked and who should book for the upcoming days, eliminating the need to remind people with messages.

The tools I have used for this project are:

* Native JavaScript
* Python
* Flask
* Firebase Messaging
* HTML
* CSS

## TentaP-API
This API handles information about booked rooms, who should book the rooms for the upcoming days, and other relevant details.

## Apikeys

A small Python application to create API keys for TentaP-API.

## TentaP-Web
The website serves as the outward face of the project. From here, you can see which rooms are booked and who should book for the upcoming days. Additionally, you can receive reminders in your browser about when a person should book, which rooms are booked for today, and which rooms are booked for tomorrow. The website also allows you to add and edit bookings.

## TentaP-Discordbot
This is the Discord interface of the API. From here, you can ask the bot about booked rooms, who should book, and other related information.
